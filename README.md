Here you can find collection of some of my solutions for the Simple Chatty Bot, Cinema Room Manager, ASCII Text Signature,  Steganography and Cryptography and Minesweeper projects from the Kotlin Basics track on JetBrains Academy

A lot of the solutions and my other experiments are in [sorted.ipynb](https://github.com/hahaslav/Kotlin-Basics/blob/master/sorted.ipynb) and [unsorted.ipynb](https://github.com/hahaslav/Kotlin-Basics/blob/master/unsorted.ipynb).
