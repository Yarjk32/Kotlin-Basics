Here you can find collection of some of my solutions for the Simple Chatty Bot, Cinema Room Manager, ASCII Text Signature, Steganography and Cryptography, Minesweeper, Number Base Converter, Indigo Card Game and Pawns-Only Chess projects from the Kotlin Basics track on JetBrains Academy

A lot of the topics solutions and my other experiments are in [sorted.ipynb](https://github.com/hahaslav/Kotlin-Basics/blob/master/sorted.ipynb) and [unsorted.ipynb](https://github.com/hahaslav/Kotlin-Basics/blob/master/unsorted.ipynb). The code of the projects itselves is in the root directory.
